# Factory Game Development Plan

## Current Status ✅
- [x] Basic HTML structure with canvas
- [x] Green background with grid system
- [x] Collapsible side menu
- [x] Click detection on grid
- [x] Responsive design

## Next Development Questions & Ideas

### Core Game Mechanics
- [1,2,3,5 ] **What types of buildings do you want?**
  - Conveyor belts (straight, curved, intersections)
  - Factories/machines (what do they produce?)
  - Storage containers
  - Input/output ports
  - Power generators

- [4&1&2 (Combination) ] **What resources/materials will be in the game?**
  - Basic shapes (circles, squares, triangles)
  - Colored variants
  - Complex shapes (like Shapez)
  - Raw materials (ore, wood, etc.)

- [I think we should have 2 systems, where you can pull straight from the menu to place something, or put something from the menu in your hot bar. it should snap to grid and have rotation ] **How should the building placement work?**
  - Click to place from menu
  - Drag and drop
  - Rotation system
  - Snap to grid

### Game Progression
- [3& make some final secret material that you can submit for $1] **What's the goal/objective?**
  - Create specific shapes
  - Reach production targets
  - Unlock new buildings
  - Achieve efficiency milestones

- [3& costs should be different materials ] **How should the menu system work?**
  - Categories of buildings
  - Research/unlock system
  - Building costs
  - Statistics display

### Visual & UI
- [2 ] **What visual style do you prefer?**
  - Pixel art
  - Simple geometric shapes
  - Detailed sprites
  - Minimalist design

- [ 1&2&3 save locally] **Additional UI elements needed?**
  - Resource counter
  - Building info panel
  - Settings menu
  - Save/load system

### Technical Features
- [ 2&3] **Game state management**
  - Save/load functionality
  - Undo/redo system
  - Auto-save

- [For now have it be snappy between grid ] **Performance considerations**
  - Large factory optimization
  - Animation system
  - Particle effects

## Immediate Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option 1: Basic Building System
- Add a simple building (like a basic factory)
- Implement placement mechanics
- Show building on grid

### Option 2: Resource System
- Create basic shapes/materials
- Add resource spawning
- Implement basic production

### Option 3: Conveyor Belt System
- Create conveyor belt graphics
- Implement movement mechanics
- Add belt connections

### Option 4: Enhanced Menu
- Add building categories
- Implement building selection
- Add building preview

## Questions for You

1. **What's your vision for the core gameplay loop?** (e.g., "Place buildings → Produce shapes → Meet objectives")
I think you should place buildings, and then use machines to turn the materials into different things
2. **What should be the first building type we implement?**
A Miner that makes iron, and a submitter, the miner should cost 5 iron, you should have 5 iron from the start & 1 conveyor & a submitter that collects resources
3. **Do you want this to be more like Shapez (shape production) or more like Factorio (resource management)?**
Factorio
4. **Any specific visual style preferences?**

5. **Should we start with a simple tutorial or jump straight into the building system?**
not yet
